# Mandelbrot Generator
## Overview
Simply a .exe application for viewing the Mandelbrot Set. It still boggles my mind that such a simple equation can generate such complexity.

I also used this project to practise coding in C#, although now that I have warmed to Python and Linux, it's somewhat fallen by the wayside.
